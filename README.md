# Data-Mining
ECLAT
# THESIS OBJECTIVES
  + Extensive analysis of shopping transactions to identify strong connections between products. ECLAT will be applied to find pairs of products that often appear together in the shopping cart, thereby identifying important association rules. From that result, we use it to predict customer shopping behavior. This helps businesses better understand customer preferences and priorities, thereby optimizing marketing strategies and product offerings accordingly.
  + The goal of this research is to create specific guidelines and practical application strategies, helping businesses seize market opportunities and improve customer shopping experiences.
# Data exploration analysis
